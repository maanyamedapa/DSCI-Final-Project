# DSCI Final Project  
Exploring how public transit accessibility and neighborhood characteristics relate to environmental and social outcomes in Los Angeles County.

This project begins with a simple data pipeline that fetches publicly available Census data for all census tracts in Los Angeles County. Over time, this project will incorporate transportation and environmental datasets to study how transit access may influence environmental burdens and equity outcomes.

# Data Sources

Below are the data sources used so far.  
This table comes from my Final Project Proposal but is simplified to match the current progress.

| # | Name / Description | Source URL | Type | Fields | Format |
|---|---------------------|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | U.S. Census ACS 2023 5-Year Data (Los Angeles County tracts) | https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5 | API (no key required) | median_income, population, households_no_vehicle | JSON → DataFrame |

For the progress checkpoint, only **one** data source is implemented in code (the ACS API), 
For this progress checkpoint, I built:

- A working data pipeline using the **U.S. Census ACS API**  
- A simple data processing step that calculates the share of households without a vehicle  
- Automated tests (`tests.py`) that:
  - verify the API returns real data
  - check that processing works
  - confirm that data can be saved to the gitignored `/data` folder

No API keys are used, and no data is committed to the repository.


Additional sources (public transit, environmental indicators) will be added in the next stage of the project.

# Results

For this progress submission, the project successfully:

- Fetches real ACS data from the U.S. Census API  
- Extracts median income, population, and households without a vehicle  
- Computes a simple no_vehicle_ratek for each tract  
- Saves cleaned data into the data/ directory (which is gitignored)

Full analysis, visualizations, and modeling at later stages of the project.

# Installation

1. **Python version:** 3.9–3.12 recommended  
2. **Required packages:** listed in `requirements.txt`  
   - `pandas`  
   - `requests`  
   - `pytest`  

3. **API Keys:**  
   - No API keys are needed for this progress submission.  
   - Future datasets (EPA AQS, GTFS, etc.) will use a `.env` file, but none are required yet.

4. **Environment Setup:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
