# DSCI Final Project  
Exploring how Bike lane accessibility and neighborhood characteristics relate to environmental outcomes in Los Angeles County.

This project begins with a simple data pipeline that fetches publicly available Census data for all census tracts in Los Angeles County.

It uses the key environmental outcome variables of PM2.5 and CES Score from CalEnviroScreen data set

2. LA County Bikeways (2024 Metro ATSP)- Shapefile containing vector data of bikeways in LA County (available at- https://data.lacounty.gov/datasets/la-county-bikeways-2024-metro-atsp/about)
3. ACS 5-Year Estimates (2023)-Demographic data (Income, Vehicle Access) via Census API or API URL  available at- https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5 )
